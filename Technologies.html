<h2>Composting technologies</h2>

<p id="approaches">Various approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients, locations, throughput and applications for the composted product.</p>

<h3>Vermicomposting</h3>
<p>Vermicompost is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and earthworms, to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (excluding nitrogen-rich meat or dairy and fats or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast. Vermicast, also known as worm castings, worm humus or worm manure, is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by species of earthworm.</p>
<p>Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage sludge</p>

<h3>Black soldier fly larvae</h3>
<p>Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae are able to rapidly consume large amounts of organic material when kept at around 30 °C.[23][24] Black soldier fly larvae can reduce the dry matter of the organic waste by 73% and convert 16–22% of the dry matter in the waste to biomass.[25][26] The resulting compost still contains nutrients and can be used for biogas production, or further traditional composting or vermicomposting [27] The larvae are rich in fat and protein, and can be used as, for example, animal feed or biodiesel production.[28] Enthusiasts have experimented with a large number of different waste products.</p>

<h3>Bokashi</h3>


<p id="bokashi-desc">Bokashi is not composting as defined earlier, rather an alternative technology. It ferments (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the soil food web (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding Lactobacilli to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment carbohydrates to lactic acid, which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to pyruvate, which enables soil life to consume the result.</p>

<p>Bokashi is typically applied to food waste from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers ("bokashi bins") typically give a batch size of 5–10 kilograms (11–22 lb), accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.</p>




<p>Bokashi offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a macronutrient of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)[30]</li>
  <li>Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.</li>
  <li>Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.</li>
  <li>Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.</li>
  <li>The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural bactericide and anti-pathogen; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.</li>
  <li>Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.</li>
  <li>The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.</li>
  <li>The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil vermicomposting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any ecosystem depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within soil water. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).</p>
