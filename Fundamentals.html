<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Composting is an aerobic method (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.[1] It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a humus-like material, known as compost, which is a good fertilizer for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, and development of internal biological heat.</p>
<p>Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carbon</strong> — for energy; the microbial oxidation of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels.[2] High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.</li>
  <li><strong>Nitrogen</strong> — to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon. High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.</li>
  <li><strong>Oxygen</strong> — for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.</li>
  <li><strong>Water</strong> — in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130–160 °F (54–71 °C) until the materials are broken down.[4]</p>
<p>The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.[5] Hot container composting focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15 it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.[6]</p>
<p>Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green).[7] Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.</p>

<h3>Microorganisms</h3>

<p>With the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost.[8][9] The composting process is dependent on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bacteria- The most numerous of all the microorganisms found in compost. Depending on the phase of composting, mesophilic or thermophilic bacteria may predominate.</li>
  <li>Actinobacteria- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, bark, etc.</li>
  <li>Fungi- molds and yeast help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially lignin in woody material.</li>
  <li>Protozoa- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.</li>
  <li>Rotifers- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, earthworms not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.</p>

<h3>Phases of composting</h3>

<p>Under ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mesophilic phase:</strong> An initial, mesophilic phase, in which the decomposition is carried out under moderate temperatures by mesophilic microorganisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Thermophilic phase:</strong> As the temperature rises, a second, thermophilic phase starts, in which the decomposition is carried out by various thermophilic bacteria under high temperatures.</li>
  <li><strong>Maturation phase</strong>: As the supply of high-energy compounds dwindles, the temperature starts to decrease, and the mesophiles once again predominate in the maturation phase.</li>
</ul>
