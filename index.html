<h1>Compost</h1>

<p><strong>Compost</strong> (/ˈkɒmpɒst/ or /ˈkɒmpoʊst/) is organic matter that has been decomposed in a process called composting. This process recycles various organic materials otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a soil conditioner (the compost).</p>
<p>Compost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in gardens, landscaping, horticulture, urban agriculture and organic farming. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a fertilizer, addition of vital humus or humic acids, and as a natural pesticide for soil. Compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover.</p>
<p>At the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called green waste), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The decomposition process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or "windrows" are used. Fungi, earthworms and other detritivores further break up the material. Aerobic bacteria and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, carbon dioxide, and ammonium.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Composting is an aerobic method (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.[1] It can therefore be used to recycle organic material. The process involves decomposition of organic material into a humus-like material, known as compost, which is a good fertilizer for plants. Composting requires the following three components: human management, aerobic conditions, and development of internal biological heat.</p>
<p>Composting organisms require four equally important ingredients to work effectively:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Carbon</strong> — for energy; the microbial oxidation of carbon produces the heat, if included at suggested levels.[2] High carbon materials tend to be brown and dry.</li>
  <li><strong>Nitrogen</strong> — to grow and reproduce more organisms to oxidize the carbon. High nitrogen materials tend to be green (or colorful, such as fruits and vegetables) and wet.</li>
  <li><strong>Oxygen</strong> — for oxidizing the carbon, the decomposition process.</li>
  <li><strong>Water</strong> — in the right amounts to maintain activity without causing anaerobic conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain ratios of these materials will provide microorganisms to work at a rate that will heat up the pile. Active management of the pile (e.g. turning) is needed to maintain sufficient supply of oxygen and the right moisture level. The air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures 130–160 °F (54–71 °C) until the materials are broken down.[4]</p>
<p>The most efficient composting occurs with an optimal carbon:nitrogen ratio of about 25:1.[5] Hot container composting focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly. Rapid composting is favored by having a C/N ratio of ~30 or less. Above 30 the substrate is nitrogen starved, below 15 it is likely to outgas a portion of nitrogen as ammonia.[6]</p>
<p>Nearly all plant and animal materials have both carbon and nitrogen, but amounts vary widely, with characteristics noted above (dry/wet, brown/green).[7] Fresh grass clippings have an average ratio of about 15:1 and dry autumn leaves about 50:1 depending on species. Mixing equal parts by volume approximates the ideal C:N range. Few individual situations will provide the ideal mix of materials at any point. Observation of amounts, and consideration of different materials as a pile is built over time, can quickly achieve a workable technique for the individual situation.</p>

<h3>Microorganisms</h3>

<p>With the proper mixture of water, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen, micro-organisms are able to break down organic matter to produce compost.[8][9] The composting process is dependent on micro-organisms to break down organic matter into compost. There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bacteria- The most numerous of all the microorganisms found in compost. Depending on the phase of composting, mesophilic or thermophilic bacteria may predominate.</li>
  <li>Actinobacteria- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, bark, etc.</li>
  <li>Fungi- molds and yeast help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially lignin in woody material.</li>
  <li>Protozoa- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.</li>
  <li>Rotifers- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, earthworms not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.</p>

<h3>Phases of composting</h3>

<p>Under ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mesophilic phase:</strong> An initial, mesophilic phase, in which the decomposition is carried out under moderate temperatures by mesophilic microorganisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Thermophilic phase:</strong> As the temperature rises, a second, thermophilic phase starts, in which the decomposition is carried out by various thermophilic bacteria under high temperatures.</li>
  <li><strong>Maturation phase</strong>: As the supply of high-energy compounds dwindles, the temperature starts to decrease, and the mesophiles once again predominate in the maturation phase.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Materials that can be composted</h2>
<p>Composting is a process used for resource recovery. It can recycle an unwanted by-product from another process (a waste) into a useful new product.</p>

<h3>Organic solid waste (green waste)</h3>

<p>Composting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable landfill space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from municipal solid waste.</p>
<p>Co-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered fecal sludge or sewage sludge</p>
<p>Industrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an advanced waste processing system. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with anaerobic digestion or in-vessel composting is called mechanical biological treatment. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating biodegradable waste before it enters a landfill reduces global warming from fugitive methane; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing landfill gas that contains methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>

<h3>Animal manure and bedding</h3>
<p>On many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal manure generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.</p>

<h3>Human waste and sewage sludge</h3>
<p>Human waste can be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in composting toilets, or indirectly (as sewage sludge), after it has undergone treatment in a sewage treatment plant. Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.</p>
<p>Urine can be put on compost piles or directly used as fertilizer.[14] Adding urine to compost can increase temperatures and therefore increase its ability to destroy pathogens and unwanted seeds. Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as houseflies or blowflies), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as parasitic worm eggs.</p>

<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>Compost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as coir and peat, as a tilth improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich growing medium as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and nutrients. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed soil, sand, grit, bark chips, vermiculite, perlite, or clay granules to produce loam. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.</p>
<p>Generally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of phytotoxins in immature compost that may inhibit germination,[16][17][18] and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed lignin.[19] It is very common to see blends of 20–30% compost used for transplanting seedlings at cotyledon stage or later.</p>
<p>Compost can be used to increase plant immunity to diseases and pests.</p>

<h2>Composting technologies</h2>

<p>Various approaches have been developed to handle different ingredients, locations, throughput and applications for the composted product.</p>

<h3>Vermicomposting</h3>
<p>Vermicompost is the product or process of organic material degradation using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and earthworms, to create a heterogeneous mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste (excluding nitrogen-rich meat or dairy and fats or oils), bedding materials, and vermicast. Vermicast, also known as worm castings, worm humus or worm manure, is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by species of earthworm.</p>
<p>Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage sludge</p>

<h3>Black soldier fly larvae</h3>
<p>Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae are able to rapidly consume large amounts of organic material when kept at around 30 °C.[23][24] Black soldier fly larvae can reduce the dry matter of the organic waste by 73% and convert 16–22% of the dry matter in the waste to biomass.[25][26] The resulting compost still contains nutrients and can be used for biogas production, or further traditional composting or vermicomposting [27] The larvae are rich in fat and protein, and can be used as, for example, animal feed or biodiesel production.[28] Enthusiasts have experimented with a large number of different waste products.</p>

<h3>Bokashi</h3>
<p>Bokashi is not composting as defined earlier, rather an alternative technology. It ferments (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the soil food web (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding Lactobacilli to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment carbohydrates to lactic acid, which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to pyruvate, which enables soil life to consume the result.

</p>
<p>Bokashi is typically applied to food waste from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers ("bokashi bins") typically give a batch size of 5–10 kilograms (11–22 lb), accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.

</p>
<p>Bokashi offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a macronutrient of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)[30]
  </li>
  <li>Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.
  </li>
  <li>Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.
  </li>
  <li>Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.
  </li>
  <li>The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural bactericide and anti-pathogen; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.
  </li>
  <li>Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.
  </li>
  <li>The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.
  </li>
  <li>The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil vermicomposting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any ecosystem depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within soil water. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).</p>
