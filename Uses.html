<h2>Uses</h2>

<p>Compost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as coir and peat, as a tilth improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich growing medium as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and nutrients. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed soil, sand, grit, bark chips, vermiculite, perlite, or clay granules to produce loam. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.</p>
<p>Generally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of phytotoxins in immature compost that may inhibit germination,[16][17][18] and the possible tie up of nitrogen by incompletely decomposed lignin.[19] It is very common to see blends of 20â€“30% compost used for transplanting seedlings at cotyledon stage or later.</p>
<p>Compost can be used to increase plant immunity to diseases and pests.</p>
